# password-generator

## Description

I built this project to allow users to generate secure passwords.

I learned a lot in this project about manipulating strings and arrays, input validation,  as well as psuedo randomization.

If I had to code this again, I would insert an extra check on the generated password to confirm at least one character of each of the chosen sets are included. That being said, based on the probability of a requested character set not showing up at the smallest password length, I believe this was safe to leave out.
